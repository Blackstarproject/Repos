In this example, an event will be raised if a change is made to the registery HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\.jpg\OpenWithProgids

The event will invoke a method passing as argument the changed key ( The event fires on the WMI thread, so you have to invoke to work with your application thread )
