to trim end:

text = text.TrimEnd({Convert.ToChar(10), Convert.ToChar(13)})
yourString.TrimEnd() 

Or:

Dim lines() As String = IO.File.ReadAllLines("d:\abc\abc.txt")
txtFirstLine.Text = lines(0)
txtLastLine.Text = lines(lines.Length - 1)
The code reads the text file and creates an array of Strings with one line in each element 
of the array.  Then it copies the first line into one TextBox and the last line into the other.  
Note that there is no way to find the last line of a text file without reading the whole file in 
some way.
